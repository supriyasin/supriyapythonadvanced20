    "#1. Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes' benefits and drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The float and Decimal classes in programming languages offer different benefits and drawbacks. Here's a comparison between \n",
    "   the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Float class:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Benefits:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. Efficiency: Floats are generally implemented as native hardware types, which means they are processed quickly by the \n",
    "      computer's floating-point unit. This makes them highly efficient for numerical computations.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   2. Wide range: Floats can represent a wide range of values, including both very large and very small numbers, thanks to \n",
    "      their exponent and mantissa representation.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   3. Standardized: Floats adhere to the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, which ensures consistency across\n",
    "      different platforms and programming languages.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  Drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Limited precision: Floats have limited precision due to their binary representation. This can lead to rounding errors\n",
    "      and loss of significant digits, especially when performing calculations that involve decimal fractions or repeated \n",
    "      operations.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   2. Inexact representation: Some decimal values, such as 0.1, cannot be precisely represented in the binary floating-point \n",
    "      format, leading to small approximation errors.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   3. Lack of control: Floats do not provide direct control over precision and rounding, as these aspects are handled by the\n",
    "      underlying hardware and floating-point unit.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Decimal class:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Precision: The Decimal class provides arbitrary precision decimal arithmetic, allowing for exact representation of\n",
    "      decimal values. This makes it suitable for financial calculations or applications that require high precision.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   2. Control over rounding: Decimals allow explicit control over rounding, letting developers choose rounding modes to suit\n",
    "      their specific needs, such as rounding to the nearest integer or to a certain number of decimal places.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   3. Exact decimal representation: Decimal values, including fractions like 0.1, are represented exactly, eliminating the \n",
    "      rounding errors inherent in binary floats. \n",
    "      \n",
    "   Drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Performance: Decimal arithmetic operations are typically slower than float operations since they involve more complex \n",
    "      calculations due to their arbitrary precision nature.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   2. Memory usage: The Decimal class requires more memory compared to floats because it stores additional information to\n",
    "      maintain high precision. \n",
    "      \n",
    "   3. Limited range: The range of Decimal numbers is limited compared to floats. Very large or very small numbers may not \n",
    "      be accurately represented, depending on the implementation and available memory.\n",
    "      \n",
    " In summary, the choice between float and Decimal depends on the requirements of your application. If you need high performance\n",
    " and a wide range of values, float is a suitable choice. On the other hand, if precision and exact decimal representation are\n",
